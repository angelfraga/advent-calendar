## Level 1 Interface
Create a grid of 24 days. Each day must display the day number.

## Level 2 Display the modal
When a day is clicked display a modal with a title, description/code and links to something you have learnt in 2020.

## Level 3 Embed a video
Embed a video tutorial that has helped you in 2020 to some of the modals. Make sure that the modal is mobile responsive.

Create a toggle switch that allows you to click on future dates.
